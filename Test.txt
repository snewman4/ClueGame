How I Selected My Test Cells:
Several of the doorway cell tests were chosen because they were in tight hallways or sections
where it is important that they point the correct direction. For example, cell (7, 4) points to
the left into the Batcave, and has only one other walkway to the right of it. Similarly, (19, 13)
is near another doorway that faces the opposite direction.

When testing to make sure that certain cells aren't door, I chose (5, 12) because it is directly
in between two opposite-facing doorways. By testing this location, I can verify that nothing is
shifted one way to either side.

When choosing the various room cells to test, I didn't test any of the same room more than once,
that way I can verify that all rooms are being initialized appropriately.
